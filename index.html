                    <p> Some say John does what it takes to push himself and his team to the next level.  He has experience in many industries in a variety of roles.  All of which have contributed to the person he is today.  
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Did he just throw my cat out of the window? You really think you
                        can fly that thing? Just my luck, no ice. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. You know
                        what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Must go faster. Remind me to thank John for a
                        lovely weekend.

                        Dinosaurs. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Yeah, but
                        John, if
                        The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.

                    <p>Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop
                        to
                        think if they should. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Yes, Yes, without the oops!
                        God
                        help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with
                        whether
                        or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
