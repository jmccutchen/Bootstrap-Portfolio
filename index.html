                        that
                        thing? Just my luck, no ice. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. You know
                        what?
                        It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. Must go faster. Remind me to thank John for a
                        lovely
                        weekend.

                        God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates
                        Dinosaurs. They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Yeah, but
                        John, if
                        The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.

                        Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop
                        to
                        think if they should. Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. Yes, Yes, without the oops!
                        God
                        help us, we're in the hands of engineers. Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with
                        whether
                        or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. </p>
